# Publish @justinmiehle/shared and reporter packages to the public npm registry (registry.npmjs.org).
# Run on push of version tag (e.g. v0.0.1) or manually.
#
# Uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no long-lived tokens. One-time setup on npmjs.com:
# For each package (shared, reporter-playwright, reporter-vitest): Package → Settings →
# Trusted Publisher → GitHub Actions → user JustinMiehle, repo panoptes, workflow: publish-npm.yml
# See https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers and SETUP.md.
